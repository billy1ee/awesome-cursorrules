# Fastify Best Practices
Use schema validation for routes and plugins
Implement proper lifecycle hooks (onRequest, preHandler)
Organize routes by domain and use proper plugin architecture
Leverage reply.send() for responses and fastify.setErrorHandler() for errors
Use fastify-cli for development and follow the Fastify ecosystem patterns
